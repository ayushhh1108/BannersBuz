                            Our 120-day promise guarantees that products do not contain manufacturing defects, and, if the product fails, breaks, or has ink issue due to a manufacturing defect during that time period, we will either replace the product or issue you a credit equal to the value of the failed product. Bannerbuzz reserves the right to investigate the claim and determine whether or not the failed product is covered by our guarantee.

BannerBuzz also manages orders within and outside of the United States, which lowers our overall cost of shipping and design.
